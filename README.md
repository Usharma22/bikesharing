# bikesharing
## Purpose:
     In this project we want to further analyze to convince the investors for bike-sharing program in Des Moines. This seemed to be an interesting and profitable project so the analysis with tableau had to be convincing. 
## Results:
   - The first analysis was to convert the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds.

- Next, we also wanted to know bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week so created another heatmap.

## Summary:
    There is more that could be analyzed with citibike data. Like, we can look which are the top 10 stations which are used as starting point, as seen in graph.

- Another, visualization that we can look into is which are the top times that citibikes are used more, in the graph as below.
